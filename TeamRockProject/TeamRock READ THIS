I created Branch no.1 for everyone to change. The Master Branch is for me only.
Make changes and push 'em and if they work well I can merge them to the master branch

You can experiment with your own local repository branches too. A branch
is just a copy of an earlier state of a project. You create a branch if
you want to go in a different direction and add new features. If the guy
in charge of the code likes it then he can merge your branch with the
master branch - implementing your code changes. Lets say you change line
no 14. If I merge your branch and my branch then I get your line 14. If
both our programs have changes made to line 14, there will be a conflict
which the lead guy can sort out by editing the text and deciding what
takes precedence over what.

I only have a gist over the very basics, will upload some tutorials from
the net. I'm no expert at this either!
